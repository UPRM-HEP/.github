# UPRM High Energy Physics

Welcome to the **University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) High Energy Physics (HEP) Group** GitHub organization.

This organization serves as a **central umbrella** for software, computing frameworks, data analysis pipelines, and machine-learning tools developed within the UPRM HEP group. Our work spans **theoretical, phenomenological, and experimental HEP**, with a strong emphasis on **reproducible research, open science, and modern software practices**.

## Our Research

The repositories hosted here will support research activities including (but not limited to):

- Collider data analysis
- Detector simulation and fast-simulation tools
- Machine learning for HEP 
- Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) frameworks
- Computational methods bridging theory and experiment
- Training modules and educational software for HEP computing
- Outreach activities of UPRM HEP group

Where appropriate, projects are released as **open-source software** to encourage collaboration and reuse within the broader HEP community.
